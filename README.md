## Parsing Movie data
My goal was to take this movie data and return a random list of ten titles from the selected year.  
*I pulled the movie data json file from [jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets)*  

**Getting Started:**
- I imported json in order to load and parse this data
- I imported random to shuffle the movie list before returning 10 random titles

**Running the Script:**   
- Once you run this script, it will ask you for a year. Based on the year you select, you'll get returned a list of 10 random titles released in that year.
- You can continually run through this program and get new results as the list keeps shuffling.
